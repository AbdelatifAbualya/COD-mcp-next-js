## 🎯 Test Queries (Ready to Use)

### Test 1: Complex Mathematical Optimization
```
Analyze and solve this complex optimization problem: A manufacturing company needs to minimize costs while maximizing efficiency. They have 3 factories with different production capacities (500, 800, 1200 units/day) and operating costs ($2000, $3500, $4800/day). Customer demand is 2000 units/day with delivery costs varying by factory location. Find the optimal production allocation strategy.
```

### Test 2: Research Analysis
```
Conduct a comprehensive research analysis on the impact of artificial intelligence on modern education systems. Focus on: learning personalization, teacher roles, student outcomes, and ethical considerations. Provide a detailed assessment with multiple perspectives.
```

### Test 3: Technical Problem Solving
```
Design a distributed system architecture for handling 1 million concurrent users with sub-100ms response times. Consider load balancing, database sharding, caching strategies, and fault tolerance. Provide step-by-step reasoning for each component choice.
```

## 🛠️ How It Works
