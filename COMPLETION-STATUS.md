## ðŸš¦ Current Status

### âœ… Ready to Use
- **Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- **Build Process**: Successful with no errors
- **MCP Tools**: Fully integrated and functional
- **API Integration**: Fireworks AI with DeepSeek V3-0324 working

### ðŸ§ª Test These Features
1. Ask complex questions to trigger CoD analysis
2. Use the sidebar to manage multiple research sessions
3. Check tool invocations in the chat interface
4. Test mobile responsiveness with the hamburger menu
5. Explore settings for CoD configuration

## ðŸš€ How to Add New MCP Tools

I've created a comprehensive guide in `MCP-TOOLS-GUIDE.md` that shows exactly how to add new tools. The architecture is designed for easy extensibility.

**Example: Adding a new tool takes just 3 steps:**
1. Define the tool with Zod schema validation
2. Add it to the tools object in the API route
3. Update the system prompt to include it

## ðŸ“‹ What's Next?

The application is fully functional and ready for:
1. **Production deployment** on Vercel
2. **Adding more specialized tools** (file processing, web search, etc.)
3. **Persistent session storage** with a database
4. **Advanced memory system** with vector search

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Achievement

You now have a **production-ready AI research assistant** that:
- Looks exactly like your original COD-studio-3
- Has powerful MCP agentic tools integration
- Supports the Chain of Draft methodology
- Is easily extensible with new tools
- Matches or exceeds the original in every aspect

## ðŸŽ‰ Ready to Deploy!

Your Enhanced CoD Studio with MCP integration is complete and ready for deployment. The merge was successful, maintaining the original design's elegance while adding cutting-edge AI capabilities.

**Run `npm run dev` and visit http://localhost:3000 to see your enhanced research assistant in action!**
