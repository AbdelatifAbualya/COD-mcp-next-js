## Test Queries to Demonstrate MCP Integration

### Test 1: Complex Mathematical Problem
```
Analyze and solve this complex optimization problem: A manufacturing company needs to minimize costs while maximizing efficiency. They have 3 factories with different production capacities (500, 800, 1200 units/day) and operating costs ($2000, $3500, $4800/day). Customer demand is 2000 units/day with delivery costs varying by factory location. Find the optimal production allocation strategy.
```

### Test 2: Research Analysis
```
Conduct a comprehensive research analysis on the impact of artificial intelligence on modern education systems. Focus on: learning personalization, teacher roles, student outcomes, and ethical considerations. Provide a detailed assessment with multiple perspectives.
```

### Test 3: Technical Problem Solving
```
Design a distributed system architecture for handling 1 million concurrent users with sub-100ms response times. Consider load balancing, database sharding, caching strategies, and fault tolerance. Provide step-by-step reasoning for each component choice.
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Automatic Tool Selection**: The system should automatically choose appropriate MCP tools based on query complexity
2. **Chain of Deliberation**: Complex problems trigger the CoD methodology with structured reasoning steps
3. **Tool Integration**: Multiple tools work together (analysis ‚Üí research ‚Üí verification ‚Üí memory storage)
4. **Real-time Streaming**: Responses stream in real-time showing tool execution and reasoning
5. **Enhanced Memory**: Important insights are automatically stored for future reference

## How to Test

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Paste one of the test queries above
3. Observe the MCP tools automatically being invoked
4. Watch the Chain of Deliberation methodology in action
5. See verification and memory storage happening automatically
6. Check settings panel to see tool status and configuration

## Success Indicators
